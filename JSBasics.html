				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2><br>
				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely populat for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser of Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p><br>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="basics">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffe, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="examples">var x;</span></li>
					<li><span class="basics">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JaveScript variables- our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="examples">var x = 10;</span></li>
					<li><span class="basics">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- <span class="examples">true</span> or <span class="examples">false;</span> null-<span class="examples">null;</span> aka nothing; Number- <span class="examples">42;</span> or <span class="examples">3.14159</span> String- <span class="examples">'Coding Dojo Rocks!';</span> Array- <span class="examples">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object- <span class="examples">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
					<li><span class="basics">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="examples">if;</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="examples">else if;</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="examples">else;</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><span class="basics">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
					<li><span class="basics">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
